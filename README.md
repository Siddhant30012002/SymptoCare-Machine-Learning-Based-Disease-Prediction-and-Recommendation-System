# SymptoCare-Machine-Learning-Based-Disease-Prediction-and-Recommendation-System
SymptoCare is a machine learning-based system that predicts diseases from symptoms and provides personalized recommendations, including medications, diet plans, precautions, and workouts. Itâ€™s designed for emergency situations where quick, accurate information is crucial for effective decision-making and health management.

## Project Features:
- **Symptoms Input**: Users input their symptoms, and the system predicts the related disease and provides corresponding medication, diet, precautions, and workout suggestions.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: The system offers tailored suggestions based on symptoms to support health management.
- **Easy-to-Use**: Designed with user-friendly input and output processes to make health management more accessible.

## How It Works:
1. **Data**: The system uses multiple CSV files containing data on diet, precautions, workout, and medication for various diseases.
2. **Model**: A machine learning model has been trained using the data to predict the most relevant suggestions for a given set of symptoms.
3. **Model Training**: The model was trained by me, and hyperparameters were fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance. 
4. **Pickle File**: The final trained model has been saved as a pickle file for easy deployment and use in future applications.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** for data preprocessing and model building
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation
- **Pickle** for saving the trained model
- **streamlit** for the user friendly frontend

## Model Details:
- The model was developed and trained by me using a dataset containing symptom-related features.
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed to ensure high prediction accuracy.
- The trained model is saved as a pickle file (svc_rbf_2.pkl), allowing easy integration into other applications or systems.
